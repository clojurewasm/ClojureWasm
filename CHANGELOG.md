# Changelog

All notable changes to ClojureWasm are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). SemVer compatibility guarantees start at the
first stable `1.0.0` tag; pre-1.0 `alpha` / `rc` tags may still change surfaces.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-16

Minor release: mainline-parity deep-dive — the `rt` namespace is gone
(`(resolve '+)` is `#'clojure.core/+`), CIDER completion reaches the
built-in nREPL completion's fidelity (classes and `Class/` static members
complete without `require`), `java.lang.Character` is complete, and
`(hash x)` values are now portable Clojure hash values.

### Added

- **`java.lang.Character` complete** — the full static surface (47 methods
  + 70 static fields incl. the category/directionality constants), with
  classification (`isLetter`, `isDigit`, `getType`, …) evaluated over
  generated UCD 16.0.0 tables — full Unicode, matching the JVM (previously
  ASCII-only). Includes the JDK 21 `isEmoji*` family, `getDirectionality`,
  the char/int overload pairs (`(Character/toUpperCase 97)` → `65`), and
  `.charValue` / `.compareTo` instance methods. The one member out:
  `getName` (explicit unsupported — the Unicode name table's size/value
  trade is tracked).
- **CIDER completion parity** — nREPL `completions` now serves every
  source the built-in serves: special forms + literals, vars with
  dash-fuzzy matching (`ma-i` → `map-indexed`), namespaces/aliases,
  classes, `Class/` static members with camelCase matching
  (`Character/isD` → `isDigit`), and interned keywords — by-name sorted,
  with `(clojure.core)`-correct namespace annotations. Java-interop
  completion works without `require`, from the closed class registry
  (no JVM-internal classpath leak).
- **`defmacro` resolves as a Var** (`#'clojure.core/defmacro`) and
  **`definline`** is available (defn-equivalent surface).
- nREPL `describe` advertises `versions.clojurewasm` (the babashka-style
  key a CIDER REPL banner can render).

### Changed

- **The internal `rt` namespace is GONE** — Zig builtins and bootstrap
  macros intern directly into `clojure.core`, so `(resolve '+)`,
  `(meta #'when)`, `(ns-publics 'clojure.core)`, doc/eldoc/completion
  namespaces, and printed values all match mainline. Kernel helpers live
  in the documented `cljw.internal` namespace. Compiled `.cljwc` archives
  from earlier versions need a rebuild (format v6).
- **Portable hash values** — `(hash x)` now returns real Clojure's value
  for strings, keywords, symbols, doubles, booleans, chars, UUIDs, ratios,
  BigDecimals, and every collection built from them (`(hash "abc")` →
  `74834163` everywhere). Records and identity objects remain
  cljw-specific.
- **`compare` returns mainline's magnitudes** for strings / chars /
  keywords / symbols (`(compare "a" "c")` → `-2`; Java `String.compareTo`
  semantics).
- **`(locking 5 …)` works** (immediates share one monitor; `(locking nil
  …)` errors, matching mainline's NPE).
- **`Double/parseDouble` matches the exact Java grammar** — accepts
  `1.5d`/`1.5F` suffixes and `0x1.8p1` hex floats; rejects lowercase
  `infinity`/`nan` and exponent-less hex.

### Fixed

- `(read-string "@x")` prints as `(clojure.core/deref x)` (was the
  internal `rt/deref`); `clojure.spec.alpha/form` shows
  `clojure.core/int?` (was `rt/int?`); syntax-quote and macroexpansion
  namespaces match mainline throughout.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-14

Patch release: the `*cider-error*` buffer works — CIDER renders numbered
causes with stack frames, phase-aware routing, and Show/Hide frame filters
against cljw, instead of "[no stack trace available]".

### Added

- **nREPL `cider/analyze-last-stacktrace` op** (+ the bare alias) — analyzes
  the session's `*e` on demand: one cause per `ex-cause` chain link with
  class / message / printed ex-data / error phase / stack frames
  (innermost-first, with `clj` / `repl` / `project` / `dup` flags and
  navigable `file-url` for on-disk frames). CIDER's rich error buffer and
  its compile-phase inline overlays activate automatically.

### Fixed

- **`*e` is now set for every caught REPL error** — Clojure parity:
  compiler-class errors (an unresolved symbol, a syntax error) previously
  left `*e` untouched; now `(ex-message *e)` works after any error, in both
  the CLI REPL and nREPL sessions.
- **`(throw (ex-info …))` carries a stack trace** — the live call stack is
  stamped on the thrown value, so user throws render frames like runtime
  errors (both backends).
- **nREPL use-after-free** — the 1.2.0 re-architecture fed the per-message
  scratch-owned request source into evals whose products outlive the
  message; long editor sessions could see corrupted strings. The source is
  now copied to the persistent arena.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-13

Minor release: the nREPL server is rebuilt to full base-protocol fidelity —
CIDER (and any nREPL editor client) now works end-to-end. Backward-compatible
with 1.1.x.

### Added

- **nREPL `completions` / `complete` ops** — editor completion (CIDER
  company/capf) over the live image: vars, macros, namespaces, aliases,
  `ns/var` qualified prefixes, with type annotations.
- **nREPL `lookup` / `info` / `eldoc` ops** — arglists + docstrings from var
  metadata; CIDER eldoc and `C-c C-d` documentation work.
- **`*1` / `*2` / `*3` / `*e` REPL history** — interned in `clojure.core`
  (upstream shape) and rotated by both the CLI REPL and every nREPL session
  (per-session isolation: tooling-session evals cannot touch your `*1`).
- **nREPL `ns` request handling** — evals honor the request namespace
  (`namespace-not-found` per spec); each session keeps its own current
  namespace, so an `in-ns` in one session never leaks into another.

### Fixed

- **CIDER REPL buffer was unusable** — the read loop blocked with complete
  requests already buffered, stranding pipelined messages off-by-one; the
  REPL prompt never rendered and RET did nothing. The transport now drains
  every buffered message before blocking.
- **Messages over 4 KiB reset the connection** — `C-c C-k` (load-file) on any
  real file killed the session. The receive buffer now grows (16 MiB frame
  cap).
- **Session identity** — every `clone` returned the same id and replies
  ignored the request's `session`; CIDER's two-session model (main + tooling)
  depends on both. Sessions are now distinct UUIDs and every reply echoes the
  request's `session` + `id`.
- **Error replies** — errors now carry the same caret-rendered text the CLI
  prints (was: a bare Zig error name like `NameError`), as the babashka-style
  three-message protocol (`err` → `ex`/`root-ex` + `eval-error` → `done`;
  was: bundled in one dict, which nREPL clients mis-route, plus a double
  `done`). Evaluation stops at the first failing form (JVM parity).
- **`*err*` output** is captured and streamed to the client alongside `*out*`.
- **`describe`** now derives its ops list from the dispatch table (they can
  no longer drift) and reports the real version (was: a stale hardcoded
  `0.1.0-pre`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-12

Minor release: new REPL / tooling surface and Java-interop additions, a batch
of GC-correctness fixes, and a WebAssembly engine bump. Backward-compatible
with 1.0.x.

### Added

- **`clojure.repl` bundled** — `doc`, `find-doc`, `apropos`, `dir`, `demunge`,
  plus a bare `(doc x)` at the interactive prompt (clojure.main parity).
- **`:arglists` / `:doc` metadata** on `clojure.core` and the eager standard
  library vars — CIDER eldoc now resolves argument lists and docstrings.
- **Regex lookbehind** — `(?<=…)` / `(?<!…)` and `Pattern.split`.
- **`format` date/time** — the `%t` / `%T` conversion family (UTC, English).
- **Namespace metadata** — `alter-meta!` / `reset-meta!` on namespaces, and a
  namespace docstring / attribute map merged into the namespace metadata.
- **Java-interop surface** — common `java.util.Arrays` and
  `java.util.Collections` statics, `String` `char[]` forms, and JVM-bit-parity
  Murmur3 hashing.
- **`slurp` / `spit` accept open streams** (the remaining IOFactory arms).
- **WebAssembly FFI on zwasm v2.2.0** — up from v2.0.0 (table64 JIT +
  AOT full-fidelity); hot loops inside a module keep running as native code.

### Fixed

- **GC-correctness batch** — several use-after-free / corruption classes under
  frequent collection: unrooted analysis-time constants, tree-walk
  native-stack intermediates, `recur` reentrancy inside lazy `for`, and a
  `rest`-of-chunked-seq self-allocation hole that could corrupt a growing
  BFS-style queue. All now hold their roots across the collection.
- **Value semantics** — sorted collections work as hash keys / set elements;
  hash-map full-hash collision buckets match Clojure; `count` on a
  `CharSequence` `deftype`; `(var alias/x)` resolves namespace aliases;
  `read-line` reads process stdin; exception `str` / `pr` and
  `*print-readably*` shadowing match Clojure.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-02

Patch release: memory-safety fixes found by a post-release audit. No API
changes. Users on 1.0.0 should upgrade — the first item is reachable from
ordinary code.

### Fixed

- **Stack overflow on deep lazy chains** — realizing or counting a lazy
  sequence / cons chain longer than ~400k elements (e.g.
  `(count (repeat 1000000 1))`) crashed the process: the GC mark phase
  descended the object graph recursively on the native stack. Marking now
  uses an explicit gray worklist (O(1) stack for any depth).
- **Use-after-free family during analysis/compilation** — GC values created
  while a form is analyzed, compiled, or AOT-deserialized (literal strings,
  quoted data, chunk constants, macro-expansion intermediates) were not GC
  roots until execution, so a collection mid-analysis (large file loads,
  user-macro expansion) could recycle them — surfacing as per-run-varying
  `Unable to resolve symbol: '<garbage>'` errors, index-out-of-bounds
  panics, or spurious "host-marker method not yet wired" errors when
  loading bigger libraries (instaparse, math.combinatorics). A per-thread
  analysis-roots frame now keeps them alive; `deftype` / `reify` method
  tables are also traced (their method functions could be collected out
  from under a live type).
- **Namespace reflection errors are now catchable** — `ns-resolve`,
  `ns-map`, `ns-name`, `intern`, `create-ns`, `alias`, `find-var` and
  friends raised an uncatchable "not supported" error on a missing
  namespace or wrong-typed argument; Clojure raises a plain catchable
  exception there, and libraries rely on that for capability probes
  (`(try (ns-resolve …) (catch Exception e nil))`). They now match
  Clojure's exception classes.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-01

The first **stable** release. ClojureWasm is a JVM-free Clojure runtime written
in Zig, feature-complete for everyday Clojure with a WebAssembly FFI as its
headline capability. The WebAssembly FFI runs on the embedded **zwasm v2.0.0**
engine. Earlier pre-releases were tagged `1.0.0-alpha.*`. SemVer compatibility
guarantees start here.

### Added

- **Clojure language core** — reader, macros, destructuring, the sequence
  library, transducers, protocols, multimethods, `deftype` / `reify` /
  `defrecord`, metadata, namespaces with lazy loading, and the numeric tower
  (long / double / ratio / BigInteger / BigDecimal, JVM-surface semantics).
- **Standard library** — `clojure.core` plus `clojure.string` / `set` / `walk`
  / `zip` / `edn` / `data.json` / `data.csv` / `math` / `pprint` / `test` /
  `tools.cli` and more, reimplemented for the runtime.
- **WebAssembly FFI** — `(wasm/load "mod.wasm")` then `(wasm/call m "fn" …)`:
  load a sandboxed module compiled from any language (Rust, Go, Zig, C) and
  call it like an ordinary function. The FFI is **JIT-compiled by default** via
  the embedded **zwasm v2.0.0** engine, so a hot loop inside a module runs as native code.
- **WebAssembly components as namespaces** — `(:require ["comp.wasm" :as c])`
  pulls a WIT-typed component in like a library; its exports become ordinary
  Vars, with arguments and results as plain Clojure data.
- **CIDER-compatible nREPL** — `cljw nrepl` for live editor-connected eval.
- **Single-binary builds** — `cljw build script.clj -o app` compiles a program
  and the runtime into one self-contained native executable (arm64 / amd64).
- **Concurrency** — atoms, refs (STM), agents, promises, futures.
- **Java-interop surface** — a curated, definition-derived subset of common
  `java.*` classes (String / Math / java.time / BigInteger / BigDecimal /
  Character / …) reimplemented natively; see `data/compat_tiers.yaml`.
