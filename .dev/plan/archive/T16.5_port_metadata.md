# T16.5: Port metadata.clj

## Plan

Upstream `test_clojure/metadata.clj` tests:

- public-vars-with-docstrings-have-added: ns-publics, require — SKIP (not implemented)
- interaction-of-def-with-metadata: eval-in-temp-ns — SKIP (JVM-specific)
- fns-preserve-metadata-on-maps: with-meta, meta on maps — partially portable
  - assoc, dissoc, reduce don't preserve metadata yet → SKIP preservation tests
- fns-preserve-metadata-on-vectors: similar metadata preservation — SKIP
- fns-preserve-metadata-on-sets: similar — SKIP
- defn-primitive-args: eval-in-temp-ns — SKIP (JVM-specific)

Create test file covering:

1. with-meta / meta basics
2. vary-meta
3. meta on different types (map, vector, set, list)
4. meta returns nil for values without metadata
5. Keyword/symbol/string don't support metadata

## Log

- Basic meta/with-meta/vary-meta all working on map, vector, set, list
- Metadata preservation across assoc/dissoc/reduce not implemented → deferred
- Created metadata.clj with 10 tests / 21 assertions
- VM: 10 tests, 21 assertions PASS
- TreeWalk: 10 tests, 21 assertions PASS
