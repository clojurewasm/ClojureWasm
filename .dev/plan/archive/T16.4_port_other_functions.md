# T16.4: Port other_functions.clj

## Plan

Port tests from upstream `test_clojure/other_functions.clj`. Test-by-test analysis:

1. test-identity — Port, skip char literals and BigDecimal/Ratio
2. test-name — Port as-is
3. test-fnil — Port as-is
4. test-comp — Port as-is
5. test-complement — Port as-is
6. test-constantly — Port as-is
7. test-juxt — Port as-is
8. test-partial — Port as-is
9. test-every-pred — Port subset (large test, depends on range/for/repeat)
10. test-some-fn — Port subset (large test, depends on range/for/repeat)
11. test-max-min-key — Port as-is (max-key/min-key already implemented)
12. test-regex-matcher — SKIP (regex)
13. test-update — Port as-is
14. test-update-vals — Implement update-vals, then port
15. test-update-keys — Implement update-keys, then port

Implement update-vals, update-keys in core.clj.

## Log

- Upgraded every-pred, some-fn to upstream (1-4+ pred arities, multi-arg returned fns)
- Upgraded fnil to upstream (1-3 default arities, multi-arg returned fns)
- Upgraded partial to upstream (0-4+ initial arg arities)
- Upgraded comp to upstream (multi-arg, variadic composed fn)
- Upgraded juxt to upstream (1-4+ fn arities)
- Upgraded update to support extra args: (update m k f x y z & more)
- Upgraded update-in to support extra args: (update-in m ks f & args)
- Implemented update-vals, update-keys in core.clj (reduce-kv based)
- Fixed applyFn: added keyword/map/set as IFn dispatch
- Fixed getFn: added .vector case for integer index lookup
- VM: 14 tests, 91 assertions PASS
- TreeWalk: 14 tests, 91 assertions PASS
