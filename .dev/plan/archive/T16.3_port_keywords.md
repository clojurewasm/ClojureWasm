# T16.3: Port keywords.clj

## Plan

Upstream `test_clojure/keywords.clj` has 2 tests:

- `test-find-keyword`: Requires `find-keyword` (todo, needs keyword intern table) + `::foo` (auto-resolved keyword, not yet implemented) → Defer to F## items
- `arity-exceptions`: Requires `thrown-with-msg?`, regex, JVM exception types → SKIP

Since upstream tests require unimplemented infrastructure, create keyword operation test file with:

- keyword constructor (keyword fn, 1-arg and 2-arg)
- keyword? predicate
- name/namespace on keywords
- keyword equality
- keyword as function (IFn on maps)
- keyword with symbols
- keyword hashing/identity

Also add F## items for find-keyword and ::foo auto-resolve.

## Log

- Upstream has 2 tests: test-find-keyword (needs find-keyword + ::foo), arity-exceptions (JVM-specific)
- find-keyword requires keyword intern table (not implemented) → F80
- ::foo auto-resolved keywords not implemented (reader needs Env access) → F81
- Created keywords.clj with 11 tests / 32 assertions covering keyword operations
- VM: 11 tests, 32 assertions PASS
- TreeWalk: 11 tests, 32 assertions PASS
