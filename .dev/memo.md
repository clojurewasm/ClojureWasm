# ClojureWasm Development Memo

Session handover document. Read at session start.

## Current State

- **All phases through 76 COMPLETE** (Type System & Reader Enhancements)
- Coverage: 871+ vars (637/706 core, 10/11 protocols, 22/22 reducers, 25 embedded CLJ namespaces)
- Wasm engine: zwasm v0.2.0 (GitHub URL dependency, build.zig.zon).
- Bridge: `src/wasm/types.zig` (751 lines, thin wrapper over zwasm)
- 52 upstream test files, all passing. 6/6 e2e tests pass. 14/14 deps e2e pass.
- Benchmarks: `bench/history.yaml` (v0.2.0 entry = latest baseline)
- Binary: 3.92MB ReleaseSafe (Mac ARM64). See `.dev/binary-size-audit.md`.
- Java interop: `src/interop/` module with URI, File, UUID, PushbackReader, StringBuilder, StringWriter classes (D101)

## Strategic Direction

Native production-grade Clojure runtime. **NOT a JVM reimplementation.**
CW embodies "you don't really want Java interop" — minimal shims for high-frequency
patterns only. Libraries requiring heavy Java interop are out of scope.

Differentiation vs Babashka:
- Ultra-fast execution (19/20 benchmark wins)
- Tiny single binary (3.85MB macOS, ~14MB Linux static)
- Wasm FFI (unique: call .wasm modules from Clojure)
- deps.edn compatible project model (Clojure CLI subset)

Java interop policy: Library-driven. Test real libraries as-is (no forking/embedding).
When behavior differs from upstream Clojure, trace CW's processing pipeline to find
and fix the root cause. Add Java interop shims only when 3+ libraries need the same
pattern AND it's <100 lines of Zig. If a library requires heavy Java interop that
CW won't implement, that library is out of scope — document and move on.
See `.dev/library-port-targets.md` for targets and decision guide.

## Known Issues

(none currently)

## Notes

- CONTRIBUTING.md at `.dev/CONTRIBUTING.md` — restore to repo root when accepting contributions
- Batch 0 = clojure.jar-bundled → embed in CW, UPSTREAM-DIFF/CLJW markers OK
- Batch 1+ = external libraries → test as-is, fix CW side, do NOT fork
- Batch 1 (medley, CSK, honeysql) already tested correctly with as-is approach
- clojure.xml now implemented (pure Clojure XML parser, 13/13 tests pass)
