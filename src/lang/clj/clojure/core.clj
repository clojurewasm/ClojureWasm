;; Phase 6.16.a-3.2 — eager higher-order surface (ADR-0033 D6 + v5 §5.2).
;;
;; Each surface fn delegates to its Zig leaf (`-foo-eager`) via the
;; `-name` Pattern B2 contract from ADR-0033 D4. The transducer 1-arg
;; arities (`(map f)` returning an xform) + `transduce`/`into`-xform/
;; `completing`/`cat`/`halt-when` LANDED 2026-05-30 (D-177, the multi-
;; arity prereq D-070 is discharged) in the transducer section below;
;; these `-foo-eager` forms are the eager collection arities. The lazy
;; `sequence`/`eduction` pull surface is the only remaining gap (D-160,
;; needs a push→pull transducer bridge).
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------

;; map / filter / keep / remove / drop are LAZY (ADR-0054 cycle 2/3):
;; each wraps its step in `lazy-seq` so it composes with infinite
;; producers (`(first (map inc (iterate inc 0)))` → 1, no hang;
;; `(first (drop 100 (range)))` → 100). `take` stays bounded-eager (it
;; realizes only N, so it already terminates on an infinite source).
;; The `-*-eager` map/filter/keep/remove/drop leaves are deleted.
;; `map` — 1/2/3-coll. Multi-coll walks colls in parallel, stops at the
;; shortest (D-134). N-coll variadic (`& colls`) deferred: it needs
;; every?/identity which are later core.clj defns (def-order; fn-body
;; symbols resolve at def time), so it would need a primitive-only seq-all.
